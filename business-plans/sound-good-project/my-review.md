## Presentation of the lab and the research team

The Sounds Good system initiated by Benoit Brouard through research conducted at the Laboratory of Solids Mechanics (LMS) at Ecole Polytechnique. The origin of project idea came from Brouard's research thesis on the behavior of salt cavern twenty years ago. Since the project will be consisted of hardware and system software, Benoit Brouard collaborate with Pierre Berest from LMS in developing a modeling tools called as LOCAS software which used to analyzing the integrity a salt cavern storage site. There are also Attilo Frangi who Associate Professor at Politenico de Milan has charge of modeling the digital simulations and Lilin Wang who Ph.D. graduate from Ecole Polytecnique has been contributed on the study to salt cavern.


## Overall presentation of the technology and the potential uses of this technology

The Sound Good is portable and non-intrusive measurement system consisted of acoustic wave measurement hardware unit and dedicated software platform that allow salt cavern operator to reduce cost and risk in monitoring the salt cavern. It basically works by measuring distances (tube length, fluid-fluid interface position) and analyzing the acoustic wave engendered by a disturbance. The measurement hardware will generate an acoustic wave in wellheads, then the data produced by this measurement will streamed into high resolution frequency data acquisition system that allow reliable, cheap and real-time monitoring. Compared to another measurement methods in the market such as Wireline, the Sound Good project offered high precision with high portability by implementing current technology advanced. The non-intrusive character is Sound Good main advantage which only required operators to installed a permanent or semi permanent small setup the wellhead and could be scaled by installing additional monitoring software as needed, such as real time monitoring through tablet.
