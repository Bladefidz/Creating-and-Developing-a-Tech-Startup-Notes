## MARKET AND NEW OFFER

The Sounds Good system is a durable technology that offers a large number of advantages compared to the current technologies. It is non-intrusive and enables permanent monitoring of the wells at a reduced cost and under better security and safety conditions. Operators of underground storage facilities can thus improve the security of cavities by preempting accidents that could have catastrophic consequences.

The new products and services that Sounds Good plans to launch are as follows:

* Development of Measuring Systems - Pre-Sale Feasibility Study / Sounds Good System / Post-Sale Service
* Expertise - Studies Sales
* Software Programs Development - Licenses Sales

The main components of this offer are:

* Customized Measurement Systems 
* Software Platform
* Associated services: feasibility tests,installation, maintenance
* Consulting services - Expertise

The main market concerns both storage of natural gas and hydrocarbon liquids as well as caverns for manufacturing salt only. Currently there are some 850 underground storage sites worldwide (with 16,000 wells) of which around 130 are in Europe.

Current solutions available on the market met insufficiently the needs of the potential customers for the following reasons:

* Loss of production
* Intrusive technologies 
* Non permanent monitoring
* Time and necessary resources to get measurements
* Depth limitation by technologies
* Risk of the operation

The market is distributed in 3 main segments:

* Europe: 300 billions cubic meters.
* Americas: 188 billions cubic meters. Service market estimation in the US is 750 million EUR per year.
* China: Only one operational salt cavern in China.

With the following expected growth:

* Europe: dozen of projects in the pipeline. Significant increase between 2015 and 2030.
* American: Expected growth around 0.9% between 2015 and 2020. Trend has been increasing for the last 20 years.
* China: Production of gas has risen for the last 15 years. Four projects in the pipeline


## BUSINESS SAND COMPETIVE ADVANTAGE

Traditional process referred to as “wireline” consisting of lowering a probe/sonar with a radioactive charge suspended on a steel cable into a deep well which mobilizes a lot of resources.These companies all propose solutions based on this reference traditional "Wireline" measurement technologies:

* Socon - german leader in Europe in salt cavern surveillance - 60 people. Sells an electronic measuring systems called BCS and SoMIT
* Flodim - french company similar to Socon at a smaller scale
* Sonar Surveys - most of the wireline surveys in the United States
* Geso - german company that works with Socon with fiber optic surveying systems

Competitive advantages of the Sounds Good solution includes precision, non-intrusive, permanent monitoring, punctual measurement, no production stoppage, short time to set up, short time to do survey, wireless, wider range of measurement, works with tilted and horizontal wells, narrow ring, no radioactive sonar, no temperature limitation, fewer people to do survey, less cost per measurement, and less cost to set up. Moreover reputation of the solution based on scientific papers, international conferences and LOCAS software are also reasons to buy more likely Sounds Good solutions.
The solutions will also be cheaper than the competition in terms of Capital and Operation Expenses. The uniqueness of the solution is a very valuable asset that has to be evaluated in correlation with the risk.

Sounds Good has to comply to  Environmental, Safety and Oil&Gas regulations, codes and standards required in this industry.
Based on the market and the regulation that applied more or less suppliers or distributors can be compliant. The sensor might be one of the components that could bring dependency. Important services providers such as Alpha Storage Services are also to be considered. The objective for Sounds Good is to capture 40% of market share in salt cavern interface measuring globally.


## ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DATA

The potential turnover, gross profit and EBITDA of the company as of Fiscal Year 2019 are as follows:

* 4.206M€ in Sales 
* 2.887M€ Gross margin 
* 1,769M€ EBITDA

From 2015 to 2019 costs are expected to increase with increasing investments in:

* R&D
* Engineering
* Production
* Sales & Marketing
* General & Admnistration. 

At the same time margins are expected to decrease as costs of sale and volume are increasing

The main risk factors that may affect the results at Sounds Good are the following: 

* Success rate of the tests and the scale up process
* Dependency on governmental authorities for salt cavern exploitation and production
* Evolution of Oil&Gas commodities Futures

Considering Fiscal Year 2019 Profit and Loss forecast the expected break even point, in terms of volume (number of orders) and in terms of value (required turnover):

* Break-Even Units at given Price is 83 units
* Break-Even Price at given Units is 23,044.77€ or 1,892,206€ over the period

The higher the fixed costs the higher the break even point. At the contrary the higher the Gross Margin the less the break even point.

The payback period of this investment is 4 years considering the following capital to launch this project:

* Initial cash balance of 55,000€
* Public aids of 170,000€ in 2015 and 100,000€ in 2016
* Long Term borrowing of 200,000€ in 2017

The financial value of such business remains in the assets saying mostly Cash and the Patents

With no history or financial statement to show results and evolution over time valuation based on current or expected EBITDA will not provide relevant information.

However similar Tech Startup companies are mostly valued based on the following basis:

* Size the market
* Estimate operating margin
* Capital intensity
* Return on invested capital


## MANAGEMENT AND HUMAN RESOURCES

The team in charge is the following:

* Benoit Brouard
* Linlin Wang
* Pierre Berest
* Atiilio Frangi

They will be in charge of::

* Technical & Scientific Head
* Administrative & Financial Management
* Marketing & Sales 
* Customers & Quality Services

Brouard Consulting SAS being a single salaried company Benoit Brouard is in charge of all these functions with the support of a Strategic Committee, Contributors and Providers.

The team in charge of the project is mostly based on R&D, Engineering and Technical skills. However considering the profiles required to cover all the functions in this structure, saying:

* Management 
* Engineering 
* Accounting 
* Human Resources
* Lawyers
* Marketing&Sales

The required technical profiles are currently present, however the commercial profiles and administrative and financial profiles does not seem to be compatible with the skills of the current team.

Benoit Brouard is going to focus on the technical development while handling general management tasks. Linlin Wang will be focusing on the Chinese market and the technical development. Strategic Committee will be consulted but not available full time. Neither will be the contributors for the Technical & Scientific.

The overall workload is primarily focused on developing the solution. Second is to develop sales force and get administrative resources. Third will be to service the solution with Customers & Quality Services. Covering all of these phase is not compatible at this stage and with the resources available

The main key steps by year: 

* 2015 - Develop the technical solution and start industrializing
* 2016 - Spend more resources to design and assemble the solution
* 2017 - Get Managing Director in place and develop Assembly and Quality * Control resources
* 2018 - Hiring Marketing Head, Sales representatives and Administrative and Financial resources

Company corporate culture is dynamism - innovation - international oriented which is in line with the HR Project.


## DIAGNOSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The Sounds Good innovation proposed by Benoit Brouard is a breakthrough solution used to answer a need from customers that are used to traditional ways to operate using cutting edge technologies. 

The obvious value for the customers is not only financial in terms on investment but also in operating cost savings. Safety is one of the priorities in the Oil&Gas industry to keep the good image by minimizing the risk of generating hazards know to the general public. 

With increasing regulatory constraints in safety and environment the market is favorable to the solution that is also getting more and more a social trend. The industry is also investing into digital resources including IoT solutions and remote monitoring like Sounds Good.

However too few financial and human resources are currently involved in this project to really take off.

The steps required to develop and market the Sounds Good offer is as follows: 

* Going from a laboratory prototype to a small scale industrial unit
* Scale up the solution
* Industrialize the solution
* Get strategic partners
* Invest in production
* Hire local sales representatives
* Develop the business
* Address new segments of market

One of the biggest risk for Sounds Good is the versatility of the Oil&Gas market like what happened in 2014/2015 with a Brent Future going from over $100/barrel to $30/barrel. Dependency to regulation and governmental authorities is pretty high which generates risks as well.

The value perceived by the customer is not immediate. Most of the potential customers will look at the solution as a necessity to comply to regulatory constraints. This should be presented as an operating tool more than a safety device. Intellectual Property could also be a risk by having a competitor filling a patent on a similar technology.

The market analysis has been well defined and so did the new offer with the competitive analysis. Economics and financial data do not seem to be in line with the available resource and having only technical profiles in the actual project team other than a Strategic Committee will not push the solution to get visible on the market. The biggest lack remains in the commercial profiles to be able to really take off.

Finally my recommendations at this stage of the project would be  to propose a few types of product/service based on personal aspirations from Benoit Brouard and his team instead of proposing the full range of solution from the licensing of the software used to servicing the product including selling the solution as a package or even consulting services.

I also highly recommend to protect the solution by filling a patent as soon as possible.

In terms of potential market the application of this new technology could also apply to the Oil Sands industry for unconventional oil production especially in Canada where environmental regulation is increasing fast which could bring new opportunities.
