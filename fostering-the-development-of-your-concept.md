## **Fostering the development of your concept**

This chapter consisted following key points:

1. The key steps to bringing an innovative project to fruition
2. The funcamentals of the company's strategy.
3. Innovative strategies: The typology and value perceived by the costumer.
4. The challenges of the intellectual property to exploit an innovation.

_Summary_

This session will familiarize you with the principal steps for bringing an innovative project to fruition. Among other things, we will evoke the fundamentals of managing a project and the knowledge acquisition process that enables you to make crucial decisions for the company over time.

We will also investigate the principal pillars of your strategic project and suggest some guidelines for the company strategy. You will be asked to understand the dynamics of the market that you are targeting and to identify what it takes to be leader in your segment. Your margin for maneuver will not be the same if your innovation creates a new market versus if it substitutes an existing offer.

We will also invite you to analyze the customer-perceived utility value, in terms of benefits as well as sacrifices.

Finally, we will tackle an essential aspect concerning the valorization of a technology and the development of a company – intellectual property – and give you several solutions in order to use it wisely.

## The principles and the managing tools of the project

In the case of an innovative project, to manage project is simply to design it and execute it. **Design** requires the identification of:

1. Scope  
   **Product Breakdown Stricture \(PBS\)** in identifying all the components of a product, result of a project. Then you must identify all the tasks required for the different components.  
   **Work Breakdown Structure \(WBS\)** in organize the tasks in hierarchy \(mother tasks and daughter tasks\) which is the heart of the project design.

2. Ressources  
   After scope already defined, you need any necessary resources to execute these tasks. Also defined who is responsible for which task in PBS.

3. Constrains  
   In the case of an innovative project, it is alsi hard to identify components, tasks and ressources from the start of the project as the project will consist in progressively identifying them.

4. Risks  
   To deal with unknown, we need **risk management**. In the case of an innovative project, we are facing unpredictable and unkown events. It is very hard to anticipate the occurence and the impact.

Book **Managing The Unkown** by Cristopher Loch introduce two methods to manage the situation of incertitude and unkown:

1. Lead several approaches in paraller in several projects and the best will win.
2. Try and make mistake, so a progressive approach of readjustment, a learning process. At first, there are so many decision to make because the uncertainties. Our goal is to minimize decision options and maximize learning process as the function of time. This method can be modeled as linear model in the image below.

**In the case of creating innovative company, the second method will obviously be the adopted one**.

Management in innovative project has an objective to reduce the uncertainty: **Formulating hypotheses**; **Start actions to confirm them**; **transform tested hypotheses into knowledge**. Book **Discovery-Driven Growth** by McGrath, given a method in the hypotheses testing as discovery process in finding valid knowledge by making a table of hypotheses:

For each hypothesis, these questions are needed:

1. What is the origin of the incertitude?
2. What is the need for knowledge?
3. According to which method of acquisition?
4. What support is needed to acquire knowledge?
5. How will the knowledge, once acquired, be integrated into the project?

Book **The Lean Startup** by Eris Reis intoduced the interative learning method:

1. Design an experiment.
2. Measure the gaps.
3. Learn and rephrase the hypothesis or move on the next one.

Summary:

1. **Innovative Process** is process of discovery and exploration, it is a learning process.
2. An innovative project always intended to realize the idea with very big uncertainty. So, the traditional project management may not worked.
3. Structure approach to manage the project.
