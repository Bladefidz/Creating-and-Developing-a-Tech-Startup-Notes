## An Overview of your financing needs and financial sources for innovation

There are five phases in logical development path:

1. Identifying an opportunity to create a new product or service.
2. Conduct the first sales.
3. Increase the technical team.
4. Improve the technology and services.
5. Increase the commercial team.

One of the main stakes of an entrepreuner is to syncronise fund raising with the large technical and commercial steps of the development of his company. Before mentioning all different sources of funding, we must first of all mention the main financial needs of a technology company. There are five stages of innovation processess as shown in an image below

Each stage has an different priority objective:

1. Maturation stage: To go from a concept to a functional demonstrator.
2. Incubation stage: To move from a demonstrator to the proof the company can be financially viable. It goes through the formulation of a business plan and ends up with the creation of the company.
3. Priming stage and consolidation: Company reaches its break-even point before speeding up its development.

At the beginning of your project, you are going to mainly study the market and the potential uses of your technology. You are the going to reinforce the intellectual property and develop then test the offer corresponding to the priority need you have found. Next you are going to market this offer and improve it gradually to achieve an increasing client. From a financial point of view, this is going to require investments, requirement, rental of office base and various commercial costs, technical and administrative.

According to thesis by Saras Sarasvathyre and Philippe Slberzahn, the creation of an innovative company is more an business of effectuation than of pure planning. The entrepreuners compare their ideas with other people and restructure their project as it is progressing.

The nature of the financing needs and the resources to pay for project vary coniderably according to your industries, the stage of development of the company and the business model. The main financing needs of a company is relevant to the investments, a variation of the need for working capital, the ability to self-finance when it is negative, the refunds of loans and of public advances, and the possible payment of dividends.

The WCR is often under estimated, even tottaly overshadowed, by the etrepreuneurs whereas it can be significant for the companies whose customers pay late and for whom the growth will devour important capital. on the contracy, some entrepreuneurs manage to make their clients pay in advance, in this case they take advantage of a negative WCR and of a large capital when the margins are also there.

The ability of self-financing tend to be negative in the case of new innovative company. Self-financing ratio measures the potential flow of the capital generated by your current activity. The flow that you would notive if there was gap in revenues and expenditures. The main charges which have an impact on your ability to self-finance are sales of cost, made of purchases of materials and products, and product costs, the expenditure of development research \(R&D\), and the subcontracting of certain works.

Refund of loans and public advances is primary one which is recorded in the balance sheet and not the financial costs which have just reduced the net earnings.

Devidends are paid out of the net benefit of the exercise or out of the company reserves. The dividends are therefore irrelevant as long as the company is overdrawn and they are rarely paid in the case of growing companies, which reinvest the whole of their benefits to develop in the shortest time possible.
