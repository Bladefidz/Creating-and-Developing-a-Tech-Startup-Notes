**Summary**: The development of an innovative technology is an exciting adventure that is often like an obstacle course when it comes to finding the first sources of financing. Though new technologies are fascinating, many investors are reluctant to finance them because there are real technical, sales and human risks at stake.

Even so, many sources of financing exist and tech entrepreneurs demonstrate tremendous creativity to successfully move forward from the development stage of a breakthrough technology to the commercialization of an innovative and profitable offer.

This session deals with the financing of the innovation and will show you how to assess your financing needs and how to find the corresponding resources. You will also gain insight into the reasoning of venture capitalists, who sometimes finance companies at a very early stage.


## An overview of your financing needs and financial sources for innovation

There are five phases in logical development path:

1. Identifying an opportunity to create a new product or service.
2. Conduct the first sales.
3. Increase the technical team.
4. Improve the technology and services.
5. Increase the commercial team.

**One of the main stakes of an entrepreuner is to syncronise fund raising with the large technical and commercial steps of the development of his company**. Before mentioning all different sources of funding, we must first of all mention the main financial needs of a technology company. Consider the five stages of innovation processess as shown in an image below:

Each stage has an different priority objective:

1. Maturation stage: To go from a concept to a functional demonstrator. Are you need very expensive budget to start or low budget is enough?
2. Incubation stage: To move from a demonstrator to the proof the company can be financially viable. It goes through the formulation of a business plan and ends up with the creation of the company. Are you need big budget in sales and marketing in order to attract costumer or you have already costumer and not consider small budget in marketing?
3. Priming stage and consolidation: Company reaches its break-even point before speeding up its development. Are you need to invest more in R&D or start to save money?

At the beginning of your project, you are going to mainly study the market and the potential uses of your technology. You are the going to reinforce the intellectual property and develop then test the offer corresponding to the priority need you have found. Next you are going to market this offer and improve it gradually to achieve an increasing client. From a financial point of view, this is going to require investments, requirement, rental of office base and various commercial costs, technical and administrative.

According to thesis by Saras Sarasvathyre and Philippe Slberzahn, the creation of an innovative company is more an business of effectuation than of pure planning. The entrepreuners compare their ideas with other people and restructure their project as it is progressing.

**The nature of the financing needs and the resources to pay for project vary considerably according to your industries, the stage of development of the company and the business model**. The main financing needs of a company is relevant to the investments, a variation of the need for working capital, the ability to self-finance when it is negative, the refunds of loans and of public advances, and the possible payment of dividends.

**The WCR is often under estimated, even totally overshadowed, by the etrepreuneurs** whereas it can be significant for the companies whose customers pay late and for whom the growth will devour important capital. on the contracy, some entrepreuneurs manage to make their clients pay in advance, in this case they take advantage of a negative WCR and of a large capital when the margins are also there.

**The ability of self-financing tend to be negative in the case of new innovative company**. Self-financing ratio measures the potential flow of the capital generated by your current activity. The flow that you would notive if there was gap in revenues and expenditures. The main charges which have an impact on your ability to self-finance are sales of cost, made of purchases of materials and products, and product costs, the expenditure of development research \(R&D\), and the subcontracting of certain works.

Refund of loans and public advances is primary one which is recorded in the balance sheet and not the financial costs which have just reduced the net earnings.

Devidends are paid out of the net benefit of the exercise or out of the company reserves. The dividends are therefore irrelevant as long as the company is overdrawn and they are rarely paid in the case of growing companies, which reinvest the whole of their benefits to develop in the shortest time possible.

When you have identified your financial needs, then try to find approriate finance resources to balance your financial plan. Or, if you lucky enough to be accepted by funding company, the technological incubators often take care of the hefty expertise and guidance fees of the entrepreneurs. But sooner or later, it will ne necessary yo take money out of savings to create the company and divide the initial capital between the main founders.

**Basically, funding strategy comes to the following path: Some technological companies manage to develop into pure self-financing from the beginning, and they just call for extra resources like grants, refundable advances and bank loans to finance possible gaps in cashflow. Once it is up and running, your main room to manouvre is then linked to your ability of self-finance.**

Other entrepreneurs however increase their capital straight away as the initial relationship is not enough to face the expenses and to the necessary investments before achieving the self-financing. These capital increases could be carried out by several types of investors which can include your family and friends, but also Business Angles and the start-up and capital funds-risk.

Another way to find fund is by pre-sell innovative products, request loans, or find capital investors in crowdfunding platform.

## What leads an individual to fund a tech startup?

A **Business Angel** is aprovidential investor. A providential investor, it is just that, in this world of new economy, it is necessary to have at the time money, that is the concept of the investor, but also the concept of welfare, as it happens, in the field of the new economy, many things which means that we sometimes need to have support.

Let's take Apple as an example. Apple, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak both starting up in a garage, and they had help from Mike Markkula who came to see them and who invested 250,000 dollars in Apple in 1977, just after its creation. Next, Google, both Sergey Brin and Larry Page conviced Andy Bechtolsheim who one of the founders of Sun Microsystems to help them.

In the reality, the first motivation of the Business Angels is really how take part in an adventure \(?\). If you are  an entrepreuneur and you can be the great wave who going to transform new economy, be aware that the Business Angels are expecting you, and tht exactly, for them, it will be what will change their life, as well as yours.

What is the selection criteria of the Business Angels?

The first selection criteria is however non analytical. The relationship between an investor and an entrepreuneur, it is a relationship based on trust. Trust is really the basis of this relationship. Which is surprising morevoer, is that an investor waits until the entrepreneur trusts and has trust in him.

Second, the entrepreneur is someone who is going to be exposed, who is gong to expose his ideas and beliefs. The entrepreneurs are these people who have vision of future. But, to be visioner is hard since there are so many uncertainties in the reality. So, an entrepreuneur should be capable in dealing with stress. To manage stress and to just transform obstacles into opportunities and one of the first entrepreuneur's abilities. The entrepreneur must always be vigilant, must be in the end able to take advantage of all the oppurtunities. Therefore an investor is also going to see how one reacts when in a situation of stress, how ones makes decisions in that situation. A good entrepreneur, is someone who, in situation of high stress, is just going to be able to make decisions quickly and is possible, the right ones, of course.

Third, is the one linked to agility and speed. One can see that what is important, is to be both agile and fast at the same time, obiously, by limiting the risks. Agiliy means take advantage of these opportunities while limiting the risk.

What are the Business Angels going to bring me?

The first constribution of a Business Angel is to be a red phone. A red phone means a direct line between one or several persons which is available at anytime of day or night, and any day of the year. It can be used in case of a problem, or if you need some advices. In other words the Business Angel knows that if you make a call, it is for something important, which is going to be heard, and the Business Angel will always be ready to take your call.

Second, the Business Angel is someone who often has a wider vision, a vision out of your ordinary life and this is going to be a mentor for you.

Third, is the impossible mission. It is just any company package, company which wants to change the world. At the same time, if we set in an analytical way, it is tottaly impossible. But at the same time, when a team is put into place, and a team both within the company, but also with Business Angels, we realise that what was impossible in the pas will be possible in the future.

Entrepreneurship is passion and live serendipity. In other words, take advantage of all contact opprtunities, and let in and choose your Business Angles.


## From the wavelet theory to the "Let It Wave" startup: financing the launch

"Let it wave" is startup that offer system solution to increase multimedia data compression. Founded by Mathematic PhD and two Proffessors. "Let it wave" has long run from early 2000 to create system prototype which required billion dollars to initiate the process. Has been once successfully pivot from image compression algorithm into High Definition Video compression algorithm. Sold at 2005, since they can not afford more money to do R&D.
