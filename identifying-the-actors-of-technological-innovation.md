Summary : Young technology companies often spring out of research work conducted in public or private laboratories. The technology transfer of this work can take place directly by license agreements. But in certain cases, the creation ex-nihilo of a company is the option used to transform academic learning and outcomes into an innovative product or service. This session will familiarize you with the purpose of a technology transfer service at a top-tier university with respect to scientific production.

You will learn about how a young researcher decided to create his own company to exploit his research work immediately after completing his thesis.

We will return once again to the importance of the team and the manner in which tech startups are structured. We will notably examine the role of the leader and conflict management, commonplace in startups.

Finally, you will hear about the experiences of two management sciences researchers who studied the emergence of several dozen cooperative scientific projects at the Ecole Polytechnique.

## From science to industry: the purpose of a technology transfer service

Almost all laboratories who have contracts with industirals are likely to impact on society at short or middle term. But in a passive world when the workforce is not enough or when the university is very proactive in promoting itself, they welcome researchers who came to see them saying, **I have a good idea**, I would like to protect it, I would like to promote it, what needs to be done?

A researcher, nowadays, as well as undertaking his research, and teach, is requested to also finance his laboratory, as well as being involved in various areas. Therefore, their time, in the end, spend on the promoting is weak if we don't give value to it ourselves by explaining how important it is. Or in another word, **pull and an attitude push for this service**. Then, when we detect the technologies which show a sign of potentially being productive, of providing services or promoting the already existing products or markets already existent, we protect then first of all.

One must make sure that we find the perfect technologies, one must make sure that we think of their market, one must make sure that we think of their market, one must make sure to evaluate the market to also answer their requests, these requests which lead to money, which allow to continue then the maturation phase or the maturing of the products in the laboratory.

**For future founders of companies who would launch themselves, there is still a prematuration phase**. Frace concerned with that by built SATT \(Sociétés d'Accélération du Transfert de Technologie\) and Saclay Plateau IncubAlliance that have role to help researchers or future founders into maturation phase. Saclay Plateau IncubAlliance make sure that don't throw away the empty boxes too soon without market or product, but that on the other hand still help the one who wants to create this box in this process, and coach him, and allow hom to do a thorough evaluation of the risks.

When one is sure of the technological maturation after all, there are a certain number of proofs of the laboratory concept, one has to be reassured with experiences, to prove that it is strong, to prove it is going to be industrialisable, even, **to prove that we are going to be able to go from a small scale to an industrial one, it is called going through a trying phase**.

## From PhD to a navigation startup: the case of SysNav

If we take a small look at what exactly used to be the market, today when we talk about navigation or location for what is application of a large public. We realise that as soon as the notion of availability or of criticality is present, there are no GPS any longer and globally it is the same for infrastructure network. But, nowadays almost of us still relly on the systems that required expensive sensors, we call it inertial navigation, for using in the submarine, hunting planes, airlanes, etc. **Roughly we have two large categories: general public who is not critical where we are going to find GPS at low price and professional applications for which the security and the availability are at stake and this particular time we will have more expensive solutions**.

"what works" from the researcher who has discovered something in his laboratory and "what works" from the industry which takes him on, there is a relatively long path which has not always been measured. So in some cases, we need to realize it by ourself as innovator:

1. Build a perfect team with balanced talents and responsibilities.
2. Find a way to fund the project or make partnership which could bring benefit to the development of project altough it is not correlated with the goal of project. In this step, we should be able intoduce the first equipment or a prototype.
3. Get to know the market and the strategy to use in order to win the market. In the case of technology based company, we relly on the technology that we have developed. So, in this case, we need to change the market perception to use our technology rather than follow the market needs. Since the market is unpredictable, it is important to keep monitoring the market, evaluate right decision each time and analyze how deep we will intercept the market.
4. Keep learning because the market and technology always change. In other hand, we can safe investment by train our employees or even ourself.
