# **Identifying the actors of technological innovation**

* From science to industry: the purpose of a technology transfer service.

* From PhD to a navigation startup: the case of Sysnav.

* Building a team, the key to success for a startup.

* The outlook in social sciences research for entrepreneurs.

Summary : Young technology companies often spring out of research work conducted in public or private laboratories. The technology transfer of this work can take place directly by license agreements. But in certain cases, the creation ex-nihilo of a company is the option used to transform academic learning and outcomes into an innovative product or service. This session will familiarize you with the purpose of a technology transfer service at a top-tier university with respect to scientific production.

You will learn about how a young researcher decided to create his own company to exploit his research work immediately after completing his thesis.

We will return once again to the importance of the team and the manner in which tech startups are structured. We will notably examine the role of the leader and conflict management, commonplace in startups.

Finally, you will hear about the experiences of two management sciences researchers who studied the emergence of several dozen cooperative scientific projects at the Ecole Polytechnique.

## From science to industry: the purpose of a technology transfer service

Almost all laboratories who have contracts with industirals are likely to impact on society at short or middle term. But in a passive world when the workforce is not enough or when the university is very proactive in promoting itself, they welcome researchers who came to see them saying, **I have a good idea**, I would like to protect it, I would like to promote it, what needs to be done?

A researcher, nowadays, as well as undertaking his research, and teach, is requested to also finance his laboratory, as well as being involved in various areas. Therefore, their time, in the end, spend on the promoting is weak if we don't give value to it ourselves by explaining how important it is. Or in another word, **pull and an attitude push for this service**. Then, when we detect the technologies which show a sign of potentially being productive, of providing services or promoting the already existing products or markets already existent, we protect then first of all.

One must make sure that we find the perfect technologies, one must make sure that we think of their market, one must make sure that we think of their market, one must make sure to evaluate the market to also answer their requests, these requests which lead to money, which allow to continue then the maturation phase or the maturing of the products in the laboratory.

For future founders of companies who would launch themselves, there is still a prematuration phase. Frace concerned with that by built SATT \(Sociétés d'Accélération du Transfert de Technologie\) and Saclay Plateau IncubAlliance that have role to help researchers or future founders into maturation phase. Saclay Plateau IncubAlliance make sure that don't throw away the empty boxes too soon without market or product, but that on the other hand still help the one who wants to create this box in this process, and coach him, and allow hom to do a thorough evaluation of the risks.
