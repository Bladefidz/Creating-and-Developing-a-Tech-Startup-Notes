## From laboratory invention to formulation of an innovative concept

This chapter consisted following key points:

1. **Starting with laboratory research** up to the decision to create an innovative company.
2. **Innovative design**, a mix of methods and practices stemming from the "science of artificial".
3. **Creating an innovative company** with several associates: What are the selection criteria?
4. **Methods and recommendations** for defining and assesing an opportunity to create a high tech company.

**Summary**: Before any technical or financial consideration, the creation of a technology company is above all a human advanture that requires each associate to make personal choice. **Besides your initial intuition that a new cutting-edge technology offer is marketable**, we want to familiarize you with several development methods and practices. Mostly you will be asked to offer what the potential applications of your offer will be and the different ways to make it stand out from the existing offers.

## From laboratory research to the decision to create an innovative company: the experience of a researcher-entrepreneur

One example of successful in France is DAMAE Medical which offered a medical imaging technology to diagnose skin's patients before doctor decide to process any treatments. The development of DAMAE Medical will depend on the maturity of the technology. There are three main phases:

1. The validation of technology.
2. Product testing in collaborative research.
3. Marketing

For these three phases, we need to work on several pillars of development of the company: **market focus**, **implementation to access it**, **development of the economic model**, or **finance**. A good entrepreneur is able to back and forth between these pillars. He has to work on all the pillars in parallel.

Advice from Hello everyone Anaïs Barut \(president of DAMAE Medical company\): For example, I am going to do a market study to define possible markets. I will then chose the most important market with the most urgent needs. After this decision, a few aspects of the company will be locked. I will be able to target the market, characterise my future product specifications, implement ways to access it, establish a shedule for the technical development. Once rational aspects have been used for the least risky choices, we often face a **cornelian dilemma**. Should the distribution be done directly? Do we need to rely on general or specialised distribution? Do I need a economic model in sales, services or licensing? When all rational sources have been used, the next choice has to be purely personal. Who are we as entrepreneur? What do we want to become? What do we want the company to become? Do we wish to be producers or to keep researching and developing? So this is a very important point. And it is closely related to my last piece of advice: the choice of your team. The team needs to vary with different profils, competences, ways to work, to see things. But the final idea must be shared by all the founders and this before the creation of the company.

## Innovative Design, a Mix of Methods and Practices Stemming from "Science of The Artificial"

The entrepreneurship is above all a social phenomeon. Social interactions are vital in all technological fields. Your projects will go further than the marketing of innovative offers. The entrepreneur pertubs the ecosystem around him but he also renews it. **The aim should be based on the equality of chances more than on the equality of fortunes**.

To understand a terms **equality of chances**, lets take Toyota as an example. This example does not means separate from the ambition of entrepreneurship, **but a big corporation like Toyota need to identify new opportunities in an entrepreunarial world**. Here is a quotation from \_Koichi Shimizu \_about the **R&D** Toyota from 1990s:

> Engineers working on vehicle projects did not think that the advanced research and development group offered useful technologies for their needs. Furthermore, research and development engineers were furstated because the technologies they were creating were useless for vehicle projects.

This organisation would have forced Toyota to be limited to incremental innovators. And yet they innovate even radically with projects such as hybrid vehivle or their complete revision of the automotive architecture which deals with compactness.

Let now, move to analytical frame of works in several industrial sectors and of interaction with big companies and startups. **First and foremost, innovation is not a balistic trajectory, but rather an innovative process**. Inovating is exploring potentiallties, contextualising them in fields, developing them for markets, and deploying them while thinking about concepts, markets or business model. So, nothing really linear or sequential.

Below are two questions to think about:

1. What are relevant markets to test and deploy an innovation?
2. Which team should you lead to this adventure? You may know that some places in the world are more likely to begin an innovation, as well as some economical zones have specific qualities. For example: **Kaizen** or **Kakushi** in Japan or **Jugaad** in India and so on.

It is worth to think about **an effectual way, to start with close analysis of the available resources and to infer from it the possible objectives and to iterate the process regularly**.

An **Innovative Process** consisted three points: **Innovation Type, Performance, **and **Process**. First type of innovation, which dimensions in technology and architecture of products, of business models, are new in this innovation? Then performance, expecially what are the dimensions to evaluate the innovation value what are the characteristic times of this innovation? And finally, process: Who works on what for the innovation? With whom or which entity can you build a relationship for your startup? What decision goes with what validation?

As Patrick Pélata said: yesterday, a brand was managing its own reputation by spending great amounts of money in advertisment, promotion and various medias, and today, with the power of social medias, this can be done by the costumers themselves.

## Creating an Innovative Company With Several Associates: What Are The Selection Criteria?

In entrepreneurship, people often go faster alone, but they go much further when they unite. Innovative entrepreneurship products are most of the time concerned by human issued. Here are a few ingredients:

1. Complementary skills and psychological profiles.  
   Complementarity is a key in enrepreneurship, **you need to clearly know what your skill are, so you add more value to them**. You must also notice areas where you dont feel very comfortable. You will need innovation and agility capacities, an open mind, the capacity to create links, creativity, audacity. You are also allowed to make mistakes.

2. Innnovation and agility capacity**  
   Choose people who will be able to progress by iteration who will go further** than already made solution, who have already been succesful in the past.

3. Perpective on money.  
   When you will need to pay for your childresn's studies, your partner will want to invest in the company. **For some people money is an aim, for others it's an indicator**.

4. Some things can be predictable  
   You know hoe old your children will be in five years, ten years, and wjat they need from you. You also know that if your associate is 50 today, you will need to anticipate a transmission.

5. Perspective on success  
   According to what you aim and how fast you want things to happen, you will not have the same needs. **Make a list of your key indicators to success for the next years**. So, you will get precious information on the vision and ambition that each has and on your conformity

6. Collective vision and goals  
   **To succeed, you need a clear and shared vision**. WIthout aim of performance there will be no successful team. We often spend too much time learning how to work instead of taking-up challanges together, which is the best way to get to know each other.

7. Prepare for the worst  
   **It is much easier to reason on a upstream disastrous scenario than in a real crisis where your personal life is in danger**. Thinking of your fears is the best way to find solutions to them.

8. Conflict management  
   Face chaos can get you more performance as it forces you to cast doubt on your operational modes and to modify what goes wrong. The risk may be even more important in teams that you already know well where tacit rule are not enough. Teams grow more in the face of adversity than in success. If the crisi is insurmontable, you will need to decide who is more likely to preserve the stakeholders. Remember that the one who has power in relationship is the one who ready to give up something.

What is recipe of the ideal team? We managed to identify a few ingredients:

1. A limited number of individuals  
   Complementary, technical and functional skills are of course needed, but also **social skills, personality traits and personal qualities**.

2. Commitment in the project  
   This does not mean you must work yourself to death. **Know your limits and resources yourself, this is absolutely essential**.

3. Passion  
   It is easier to be fully engaged when youa are passioante about what your do, anout the project of the company you work on or about the people with whom you work. **Passion is the fuel to tenacity**.

4. Common goals  
   A clear and shared vision will give meaning to everyone's action even \(and above all\) when they are difficult or thankless.

5. Collective approach  
   A vision is not enough, you need strategy and organization to perform. A succesfull team makes it own rules, respects them and makes them be respected.

6. Solidarity  
   You have to worry about the other's success and feel co-responsible in case of success or failure.

7. Pleasure and humor  
   You dont necessarily need to become best friends, but pleasure avoids other displeasures and is the motivation, so you should not do without it and create opportunities for it. Celebrate success, thank others, have fun, make a team feeling proud, ... these are big morale booster for everyone. Don't forget that feelings are contagious, so smile. Communication, again, and again. Whatever you do; communicate. Event when you wuthdraw into silences.

## Methods and Recommendations for Defining and Assesing an Opportunity to Create a Tech Company

**Market and indsutry are different**. For example, there is a laser industry, but there are no laser market, instea there are existed welding market, a cutting market, and market for the organisation of audoturiums. These three markets represent the use of lasers. So, from one technique or even a patent, a technical knowledge, there is only one industry. So, if you are a marketer on laser, it is not entirely true that you work on laser market, but on laser industry.

**Market**, by definition of economics is where the **price balances supply and demand**. It is indeed certainly true, but** it is not directly useful for a person who develops a company** unless it is a very big company.

**Derek Abell's analysis** is good want to follow:

> There is a certain amount of uses, functions, even desires which are satisfied by offer.

For example, the desire for clean heair is a hygenic desire, but the desire to be beautiful which probably requires shampoo as well is not of the same kind. A good shampoo will accomplish both. A good shampoo will accomplish both. A shampoo which only  accomplishes the first idea - to clean hair - doesn't have a great value, is not expensive, it is classical chemistry. A shampoo that makes you beautiful is almost from the myths of Faust and is worth a fortune.

In the marketting, knowing opportunity such as consument's desire is not enough. One thing which worth to think about is **subtitution**. For an example above, what is might be the first subtitute? Well, it's might not another shampoo like yours, but it is "I do not wash my hair". This is what we call a **shadow competitor**. So you must decide between a market with many shadow competitors.

If your invention is an innovative you have chances to create the market and to open it up. Surprising example can be used. Let's say I am a car salesman. My subtitue, appart from other car salesmen are holiday commercials. Why? Because we are competitors in the family budget, people have the choice between buying a new car and having cheap holidays, or, on the contrary, having expensive holidays and keeping the old car and just changing the break pads.

**look at the value of the costumer's point of view and don't convince yourself that he/she will find the value exceptional**. **If you are a small company with an exceptional invention, such as a software, your value is  not a problem, the problem is the possibility that you will not exist more than two years and that the company working with you will be in midstrem and you won't be able to follow its development as you wouldn't exist anymore**. Maybe a less technological company, less efficient but more perennial, would be better. So take a look at the possible risks for your costumer and try to reassure him. Be sure that you work at the same rythm as your costumer, canvass at the right time, find the moment when his need is important, don't lose your time as many entrepreneurs do while you wish to have more costumers in very big companies of CAC 40 who will accept to receive you because they like what you do and say but will change the meeting into a subliminal or implicit training for their teams. You will explain what you do but you won't necessarily get a contract.

To conclude, if you want to  diffenrenciate yourself and look credible, you need three rules. The first one is to be comprehensible,  it must be significant for the buyer, it must create something good for him/her; either less risks or more value, or the right time. So it must be significant. It must have the possibility to gain value from the company on its value market, so check how the costumer valorises. And finally, it must be  opposable to competition, it must defend against competition, so that it brings something difficult to imitate and it can be the position of your own brand
