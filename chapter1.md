# From laboratory invention to formulation of an innovative concept

This chapter consisted following key points:

1. **Starting with laboratory research** up to the decision to create an innovative company.
2. **Innovative design**, a mix of methods and practices stemming from the "science of artificial".
3. **Creating an innovative company** with several associates: What are the selection criteria?
4. **Methods and recommendations** for defining and assesing an opportunity to create a high tech company.

**Summary**: Before any technical or financial consideration, the creation of a technology company is above all a human advanture that requires each associate to make personal choice. **Besides your initial intuition that a new cutting-edge technology offer is marketable**, we want to familiarize you with several development methods and practices. Mostly you will be asked to offer what the potential applications of your offer will be and the different ways to make it stand out from the existing offers.

# From laboratory research to the decision to create an innovative company: the experience of a researcher-entrepreneur

One example of successful in France is DAMAE Medical which offered a medical imaging technology to diagnose skin's patients before doctor decide to process any treatments. The development of DAMAE Medical will depend on the maturity of the technology. There are three main phases:

1. The validation of technology.
2. Product testing in collaborative research.
3. Marketing

For these three phases, we need to work on several pillars of development of the company: **market focus**, **implementation to access it**, **development of the economic model**, or **finance**. A good entrepreneur is able to back and forth between these pillars. He has to work on all the pillars in parallel.

Advice from Hello everyone Anaïs Barut \(president of DAMAE Medical company\): For example, I am going to do a market study to define possible markets. I will then chose the most important market with the most urgent needs. After this decision, a few aspects of the company will be locked. I will be able to target the market, characterise my future product specifications, implement ways to access it, establish a shedule for the technical development. Once rational aspects have been used for the least risky choices, we often face a **cornelian dilemma**. Should the distribution be done directly? Do we need to rely on general or specialised distribution? Do I need a economic model in sales, services or licensing? When all rational sources have been used, the next choice has to be purely personal. Who are we as entrepreneur? What do we want to become? What do we want the company to become? Do we wish to be producers or to keep researching and developing? So this is a very important point. And it is closely related to my last piece of advice: the choice of your team. The team needs to vary with different profils, competences, ways to work, to see things. But the final idea must be shared by all the founders and this before the creation of the company.

## Innovative Design, a Mix of Methods and Practices Stemming from "Science of The Artificial"

The entrepreneurship is above all a social phenomeon. Social interactions are vital in all technological fields. Your projects will go further than the marketing of innovative offers. The entrepreneur pertubs the ecosystem around him but he also renews it. **The aim should be based on the equality of chances more than on the equality of fortunes**.

To understand a terms **equality of chances**, lets take Toyota as an example. This example does not means separate from the ambition of entrepreneurship, **but a big corporation like Toyota need to identify new opportunities in an entrepreunarial world**. Here is a quotation from \_Koichi Shimizu \_about the **R&D** Toyota from 1990s:

> Engineers working on vehicle projects did not think that the advanced research and development group offered useful technologies for their needs. Furthermore, research and development engineers were furstated because the technologies they were creating were useless for vehicle projects.

This organisation would have forced Toyota to be limited to incremental innovators. And yet they innovate even radically with projects such as hybrid vehivle or their complete revision of the automotive architecture which deals with compactness.

Let now, move to analytical frame of works in several industrial sectors and of interaction with big companies and startups. **First and foremost, innovation is not a balistic trajectory, but rather an innovative process**. Inovating is exploring potentiallties, contextualising them in fields, developing them for markets, and deploying them while thinking about concepts, markets or business model. So, nothing really linear or sequential.

Below are two questions to think about:

1. What are relevant markets to test and deploy an innovation?
2. Which team should you lead to this adventure? You may know that some places in the world are more likely to begin an innovation, as well as some economical zones have specific qualities. For example: **Kaizen** or **Kakushi** in Japan or **Jugaad** in India and so on.

It is worth to think about **an effectual way, to start with close analysis of the available resources and to infer from it the possible objectives and to iterate the process regularly**.

An **Innovative Process** consisted three points: **Innovation Type, Performance, **and **Process**. First type of innovation, which dimensions in technology and architecture of products, of business models, are new in this innovation? Then performance, expecially what are the dimensions to evaluate the innovation value what are the characteristic times of this innovation? And finally, process: Who works on what for the innovation? With whom or which entity can you build a relationship for your startup? What decision goes with what validation?

As Patrick Pélata said: yesterday, a brand was managing its own reputation by spending great amounts of money in advertisment, promotion and various medias, and today, with the power of social medias, this can be done by the costumers themselves.

## Creating an Innovative Company With Several Associates: What Are The Selection Criteria?

In entrepreneurship, people often go faster alone, but they go much further when they unite. Innovative entrepreneurship products are most of the time concerned by human issued. Here are a few ingredients:

1. Complementary skills and psychological profiles.  
   Complementarity is a key in enrepreneurship, **you need to clearly know what your skill are, so you add more value to them**. You must also notice areas where you dont feel very comfortable. You will need innovation and agility capacities, an open mind, the capacity to create links, creativity, audacity. You are also allowed to make mistakes. Choose people who will be able to progress by iteration who will go further than already made solution, who have already been succesful in the past.

2. Perpective on money.  
   When you will need to pay for your childresn's studies, your partner will want to invest in the company. **For some people money is an aim, for others it's an indicator**.
