# From laboratory invention to formulation of an innovative concept

This chapter consisted following key points:

1. **Starting with laboratory research** up to the decision to create an innovative company.
2. **Innovative design**, a mix of methods and practices stemming from the "science of artificial".
3. **Creating an innovative company** with several associates: What are the selection criteria?
4. **Methods and recommendations** for defining and assesing an opportunity to create a high tech company.

Summary: Before any technical or financial consideration, the creation of a technology company is above all a human advanture that requires each associate to make personal choice. **Besides your initial intuition that a new cutting-edge technology offer is marketable**, we want to familiarize you with several development methods and practices. Mostly you will be asked to offer what the potential applications of your offer will be and the different ways to make it stand out from the existing offers.

# From laboratory research to the decision to create an innovative company: the experience of a researcher-entrepreneur

One example of successful in France is DAMAE Medical which offered a medical imaging technology to diagnose skin's patients before doctor decide to process any treatments. The development of DAMAE Medical will depend on the maturity of the technology. There are three main phases:

1. The validation of technology.
2. Product testing in collaborative research.
3. Marketing

For these three phases, we need to work on several pillars of development of the company: **market focus**, **implementation to access it**, **development of the economic model**, or **finance**. A good entrepreneur is able to back and forth between these pillars. He has to work on all the pillars in parallel.

Advice from Hello everyone Ana√Øs Barut \(president of DAMAE Medical company\): For example, I am going to do a market study to define possible markets. I will then chose the most important market with the most urgent needs. After this decision, a few aspects of the company will be locked. I will be able to target the market, characterise my future product specifications, implement ways to access it, establish a shedule for the technical development. Once rational aspects have been used for the least risky choices, we often face a cornelian dilemma. Should the distribution be done directly? Do we need to rely on general or specialised distribution? Do I need a economic model in sales, services or licensing? When all rational sources have been used, the next choice has to be purely personal. Who are we as entrepreneur? What do we want to become? What do we want the company to become? Do we wish to be producers or to keep researching and developing? So this is a very important point. And it is closely related to my last piece of advice: the choice of your team. The team needs to vary with different profils, competences, ways to work, to see things. But the final idea must be shared by all the founders and this before the creation of the company.
