# Defining Your Business Model

* Making the leap from the academic to the business world: a researcher/entrepreneur explains.
* Piloting the transition from technology to value proposition and business model.
* The business plan: its importance and limitations for the creators of an innovative company.
* From the creation of a startup to the IPO: the example of Cellectis.

**Summary**: Developing a technology, building a team and financing the startup are not the only challenges that you and your colleagues will face. The elaboration of a credible value proposition and a scalable and profitable business model require a lot of back-and-forth discussions because the clients and sales terms and conditions of your offer will often be very different than originally planned.

To win over financial partners, you will have to present the essentials of your project in a business plan and we will familiarize you with its main components in this session.

Finally, you will view two case studies about entrepreneurs who created their companies on the basis of their research work. One of them sold his company and the other did several rounds of venture capital to speed up development before his IPO.


## Making the leap from the academic to the business world: a researcher/entrepreneur explains

Academic environment tend to isolated from business world. This is because academic world need to focus on being pure minded rather that try to test any assumption that may be worked in the real world practice. The lack of being pure minded is not ready to transform any untested idea into innovative product. In the academic world, isolation is always needed to reduce any constrains and also naive assumption that may reduce the process of research or experiment. This is contrast with the reality in business world that we can not avoid any constrains and assumptions while conducting innovative process.

So, to making leap from the academic into business world, we need being agile while stay in lean methodology. Being agile also means we capable to accept any ideas, suggestions, or even critics from any directions such as from people with varieties of background: business, academic, commercial, etc. To stay in lean methodology may harder, it's means we need to understand the limitation of our knowledges while know exactly how to find any right resources to reduce knowledge gaps and also understand the limitation of our resources and know exactly what we can achieve by using current resources and when to do expensive effort such as hire new employees.


## From the technology to the value proposition and business model

The theories of growth introduce economic models that are based on factors of growth:

* [Robert Solow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Solow) who won 1987 Nobel Prize in Economics has been quantifies these factors. Solow's model focused on four variables: `Output (Y)`, `Capital (K)`, `labor (L)`, and `Effectiveness of labor (A)`; such that: `Y(t) = F(K(t), A(t)L(t))`, where `t` is time. This model implied that:
	
	1. Only growth in `A` can lead to permanent growth in `capital per worker (K/L)`.
	2. Long run `Output per worker (Y/L)` depends only on technological process.
	3. Saving and population growth affect `K/L` trough their impact on `K/L`

	Please read [Advanced Macroeconomic](https://knustesa.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/advanced-macroeconomics-by-david-romer.pdf) at page 5-26 for more information or [this note](literatures/Solow-Growth-Model.pdf).

* [Joseph Schumpeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter) who first person to theories about entrepreneurship. Schumpeter's model focus on innovation-based economic growth using four variables: `Output (Y)`, `Consumption (C)`, `Intermediate good production (X)`, and `R&D (R)`; such that people consume unique good, called final good that satisfy: `Y(t) = C(t) + X(t) + R(t)` where `t` is time. This model implied that:

	1. Microeconomic theory of R&D integrate into a macroeconomic growth model.
	2. Capitalist who used new technology and new method always wins from who used old technology and old method if only if capitalists have full control to exploit consumer (creative destruction).
	3. Log-run growth is determined by the competitive process of creative destruction.

	Point 2 maybe wrong, so please read [this note](literatures/The-Schumpeterian-Model.pdf) for further explanations.

* [Jean Tirole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Tirole) who won 2014 Nobel Prize in Economics focused on the question of regulation and business model, especially two-sided business model. A two-sided market is where a platform will allow several stakeholders to meet, to each add a value in and be of interest as regards the interaction of a platform. Please read [Economics for the Common Goods](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10919.html) for more understanding.

To be more specific, lets start think about business model. Think business model as an explanation of the way your business operates, identify who client is, what they do value, and more globally, how the business operates. The business model explains the mechanisms through which you may expect profits, but also the economic logic for value creation with the clients and how to keep your costs at an acceptable level as to expect profitability. You must be able to specify the elements that are essential to your activity. The business model must, thus, describe the market onto which you consider operating but also the value proposition you will offer to your clients, the whole value streams, a costs structure which allows to expect profitability, your value network an strategy regarding competition.

How can you design your business model:
	
1. Think that the business model is not obvious, your responsibility is to understand the choices you are capable of making at a given moment, to analyses their predictable consequences an to constantly iterate.
2. Know to differentiate the decisions you make and of which you decide they will fix one aspect of your business model or the other; and those which, on the contrary, rely on yet very uncertain knowledge and thus deserve further explorations to progress.


## The business plan: its importance and limitations for the creators of an innovative company

A business plan serves to finance a project, to get capital aid or investors whether they be internal or external. The business plan must be adapted to the audience to which you will submit it, because the audience may completely vary. If you try and get subsidies, you will talk jobs creation, you will talk land management. If you try and get venture capital funds, you will talk capital gains accrued.

Statistically speaking, every year at French, over 2,000 executive summaries are sent to an average venture capital firm. 75% loss from the beginning since only 500 of the business plans will be read. And then, there is another 40% loss since these investors only agree to a little less than 200 appointments. In the end, between 0.5% and 1% of the business plans get financed.

Here suggestions to create business plan in nine parts plan:

1. Explain how strong are the assets that are available for the team, intellectual property, the expertise, networks, and so on.
2. Start a segmentation process to explain which are the most interested clients and which are the most profitable.
3. Quick scan of the competition and dovetail, differentiate your business from the most dangerous competitor.
4. Reflection point which need expertise guidance.
5. Switch to the operational stage of the business, such as how to get clients, practice, how it is works, and how much it will cost.
6. Create a time lines to answer how long will it take, and implicitly, how much time this will all cost us?

Beware, Between 60% and 80% of the new products that are launched each year fail, one of the main reasons for this failure is the incapability to understand who is the real competitor.


## From the creation of a startup to the IPO: the example of Cellectis

Cellectis is genome engineering startup founded by two researchers from Institute of Pastour. They found a kind of molecule that capable to copy and paste DNA of host organism. They called it as 'scissor molecule'. This molecule is very phenomenal such that can be applied in many engineering fields, such as pharmacy, storage, agricultural, etc. At 1999, they decided to create a startup that offer bioengineering solution as platform. At the beginning founded, they try to explore the market by welcoming many consumers as possible and try to do what they want. They also do lot of experiments in agricultural innovations while gaining some R&D in medical engineering. At 2005, they decided to change direction from wide platform into cancer medication solution.
