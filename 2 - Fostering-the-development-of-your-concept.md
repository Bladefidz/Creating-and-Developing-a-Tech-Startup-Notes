# **Fostering the development of your concept**

This chapter consisted following key points:

1. The key steps to bringing an innovative project to fruition
2. The funcamentals of the company's strategy.
3. Innovative strategies: The typology and value perceived by the costumer.
4. The challenges of the intellectual property to exploit an innovation.

_Summary_

This session will familiarize you with the principal steps for bringing an innovative project to fruition. Among other things, we will evoke the fundamentals of managing a project and the knowledge acquisition process that enables you to make crucial decisions for the company over time.

We will also investigate the principal pillars of your strategic project and suggest some guidelines for the company strategy. You will be asked to understand the dynamics of the market that you are targeting and to identify what it takes to be leader in your segment. Your margin for maneuver will not be the same if your innovation creates a new market versus if it substitutes an existing offer.

We will also invite you to analyze the customer-perceived utility value, in terms of benefits as well as sacrifices.

Finally, we will tackle an essential aspect concerning the valorization of a technology and the development of a company – intellectual property – and give you several solutions in order to use it wisely.

## The key steps to bringing an innovative project to fruition

A **project** is a combination of human and non-human, material and immaterial resources used for a temporary organisation with a specific goal. So, there are three definition in this definition:

1. **Temporary dimension**  
   For example, _time_. By convention, members of an innovating entrepreneurship can fix an event or a period to mark the end of a project, launch on the market, validation of the technology if it is a big technological change, the first introductions, etc.

2. **Specific goal**  
   An innovative project is characterised by a big uncertainty on technology, its use, the features which have value for the users, the buyers, what value will they give?

3. **Resources**.  
   In project management, there are managing tools for stakeholders. _Primary stakeholders_ whom contributing directly \(example: Project manager\) or inderectly \(example: the future users, buyes, the purchasing advisors, distributors, financiers, incubators.\) to the project.

### The principles and the managing tools of the project

In the case of an innovative project, to manage project is simply to design it and execute it. **Design** requires the identification of:

1. Scope  
   **Product Breakdown Stricture \(PBS\)** in identifying all the components of a product, result of a project. Then you must identify all the tasks required for the different components.  
   **Work Breakdown Structure \(WBS\)** in organize the tasks in hierarchy \(mother tasks and daughter tasks\) which is the heart of the project design.

2. Ressources  
   After scope already defined, you need any necessary resources to execute these tasks. Also defined who is responsible for which task in PBS.

3. Constrains  
   In the case of an innovative project, it is alsi hard to identify components, tasks and ressources from the start of the project as the project will consist in progressively identifying them.

4. Risks  
   To deal with unknown, we need **risk management**. In the case of an innovative project, we are facing unpredictable and unkown events. It is very hard to anticipate the occurence and the impact.

Book **Managing The Unkown** by Cristopher Loch introduce two methods to manage the situation of incertitude and unkown:

1. Lead several approaches in paraller in several projects and the best will win.
2. Try and make mistake, so a progressive approach of readjustment, a learning process. At first, there are so many decision to make because the uncertainties. Our goal is to minimize decision options and maximize learning process as the function of time. This method can be modeled as linear model in the image below.

**In the case of creating innovative company, the second method will obviously be the adopted one**.

Management in innovative project has an objective to reduce the uncertainty: **Formulating hypotheses**; **Start actions to confirm them**; **transform tested hypotheses into knowledge**. Book **Discovery-Driven Growth** by McGrath, given a method in the hypotheses testing as discovery process in finding valid knowledge by making a table of hypotheses:

![](/assets/hypothesis-testing.png)

For each hypothesis, these questions are needed:

1. What is the origin of the incertitude?
2. What is the need for knowledge?
3. According to which method of acquisition?
4. What support is needed to acquire knowledge?
5. How will the knowledge, once acquired, be integrated into the project?

Book **The Lean Startup** by Eris Reis intoduced the interative learning method:

1. Design an experiment.
2. Measure the gaps.
3. Learn and rephrase the hypothesis or move on the next one \(repeat to step 1 after filtration\).

Summary:

1. **Innovative Process** is process of discovery and exploration, it is a learning process.
2. An innovative project always intended to realize the idea with very big uncertainty. So, the traditional project management may not worked.
3. Structure approach to manage the project.

## The fundamentals of the company’s strategy

The most of **mistakes** that people make in management don't come from wrong answer to clever questions, but from **right answer to wrong questions**. There are **three fundamental pillars** for your strategic project which are like a tripod on which your project can be stable:

1. Want-to-do \(aspiration of the management team\)  
   Express the aspirations of the management team. Everyone has their fundamental aspiration, own idea to the project \(tend to be vague\), and maybe does not want to controlled by someone \(for example: Finance person\).  To avoid conflicts, the best thing to do is keep working on design.

2. Know-how \(competence of the team\)  
   This is about technological projects, scienctific and technical skills are the essence of the project. However, a fundamental question will need to be quickly asked: _Will the pictured configuration be implemented without any additional competence missing at the beginning_? Most of time these are business competences and sometimes financial competences

3. Can-do \(time, human, and financial resources\)  
   It refers to available means and ressources. _How much time do we have to complete this project? Who in the founding team will have time to develop the offer, seek funds, contact the first costumers? What should prevail \(should be successful\)? The available means or the conducted strategy? Should we adapt the strategy according to the mean or, on the contrary, determine strategy and then define the mobilised means?_

**Four fundamental principles**:

1. Aim for victory  
   Decide to enter a particular industry on specific market to keep being **small player** or have **marginal position**.

2. Build its strengths  
   Identify the key strengths of your project, the characteristic that make it a competitive offer. Look for the points of differentiation shich will make the difference with competitors. Invest on these key strenghts to increase the difference. Identify the project's weakness.

3. Estimate the risk  
   The risks may can not be removed, but can be minimized. Two dimension can be taken into consideration, **Visibility**: _How reliable can change in the environtment be predicted? What is the degree of technological uncertainty? So, do we **see clear enough through space and time**? Can it be easily reoriented by changing the structure?_

It is crucial for the success of the project to closely monitor the evolution of the volume, of the prices and costs. **The growth of a market ususlly follows an S-curve**:

![](/assets/image113.png)

This curve is observed from most of market's history that can be proof by this Successive S-Curves of Mass-Market Technology Adoption \(Excluding Software\), our goal is to **accelerate the process**:

![](/assets/consumption spreads.gif)

Lets concentrate to first two phases: **Start** \(birth\) and **Growth**. The growth dynamics depend on two phenomena: _Penetration_ \(the number of costumers\) and _consumption_ \(the consumption of each of them\). So, the market can grow either by increasing the number of costumers using the product, or by increasing their consumption. There are two fundamental questions remain: _How fast will the offer enter the market? And, at what level of penetration will growth slow down?_

Another fundamental phenomenom is **substitution**. Generally, a start-up arrives on the existing market with a more or less innovative offer. So, **it will present a substitue of what already exists**. So, it is important ti understand the obstacles, the reluctances, and to **deeply analyse the decision-making process of the buyers**. Be aware of the psychological obstacles: Habits are hard to change, because the **customer must unlearn a practice that always satisfied him/her and adopt a new technology**.

In the case to analyze and learn consumer behaviors that often not homegeneous, we may choose iterative process that leads certains valid data and try to do forescasting. Let's imagine that the **initial plan** is presented by the **blue curve** and that **reality** is represented by the **red curve**.

![](/assets/adoption-curve.png)

Two major consequences appears: On a given date, incomes are not realised and the number of costumers \(so sales revenue\) are way below the forecast. To solve this, we will have to be **flexible and market-driven**. To do this, pamper your first costumers because they will be demanding, but they will help you develop your offer, they will make you progress. Furthermore, they will be your most loyal defenders, and often your most efficient commercials.

## Innovative strategies: The typology and value perceived by the costumer

Lets start from the essential question: _What type is my innovation, and, of course, what effects does it have?_

* Product vs process type
* Incremental vs radical
* Modular vs architechtural
* etc

To answer these question, we can use one of these method:

1. Isolated innovation  
   It is an innovation that works alone, for example: BIC \(pen brand\) the ball-pen tip. The advantage is you are the one making decisions, but disadvanatge is that you don't have any particular allies, so you will have to work alone.

2. Systematic innovation  
   The innovation is integrated in the system. For example: A USB strick which need USB port and software, so in this case, we need allies.

And we need to choose one of these strategies:

1. Creation  
   The innovation can create a new market. It is rare and pretty exceptionnal, for example: Renault Escape which created a new segment in the auto industry, Google who created new digital advertising market.

2. Substitution  
   This is 98% of the cases in terms of innovation. There are references for the requests, a market, and competitors. We have a reference system and we will be placed according to this reference system.

3. Standard  
   We can choose to introduce new standard or improving existing standard without significantly changing the existing standard. For example: Computer peripheral, communication protocols, etc.

Then a question related to our innovation: _What is the value created by my innovation?_ This is not simpy as financial value, but value create by the costumer. This is what we called **Value in Use Perceived by the Costumer **\(**VUPC**\): It is a compromise between the benefits that the costumer will percieve for your innovation and the sacrifices that the costumer links to your innovation. In the case of creative innovations, we speak in absolute value, and for substitution innovation, in differencial value, benefits, sacrifies perceived by the costumer of my innovation in relation to the reference offer. We can use quantitive analysis to measure VUPC, but it is tend to be subjective.

## The challenges of the intellectual property to exploit an innovation

In Europe and in the world, the modern economy is based on the free flow of knowledge, goods and products. The intellectual property is an exception as it is legitimate to reserve a situation which is privileged towards the one who dares to innovate, to create instead of having the work done by someone and take advantage of it. A technical solution to a technical issue, the design right allows you to protect the design of the product, the trademark protects a distinguishing feature, and the copyright protects intellectual works.

The intellectual property is a real issue for either the big and small companies. **Copyright** is a right to a property and a right to property is like the ownership of your flat. While the **industrial property** is a tool to clarify the relations with third parties, with scientific partners, industrial or business partners. The industrial properties is also often represented as a **weapon** and tool to be able to develop a company project safely, ensuring that everyone's position is repected.

A project leader must develop two types of skills to correctly use the industrial property:

1. Able to identify what is potentially protectable.
2. Determine any potentials that could be protected.

By patenting inovative products or ideas, it does not means we can get a ticket for luxuary free vacation \(like Bill Gate with Microsoft Windows\). Today, the best protection stays speed. Speed of your market deployment and speed of the regeneration of your products. If you don't go faster to take over the space, your market, sooner or later competitors will do it instead of you. Industrial property will, at best, be used to slow down a little the bench of competitors.

For a start-up, industrial property is an important issue. On one hand, because it is always its only asset, and on another, because it can not relatively afford much for patent registration, trademark, or design right. At the beginning, a project leader should decide the strategy policy of industrial property. For this, it is important to know the landscape of intellectual property, in other words: _What do the main actors of his field of activity do? Who registers patents? What are those patents about? What trademarks are registered by a third party?_
